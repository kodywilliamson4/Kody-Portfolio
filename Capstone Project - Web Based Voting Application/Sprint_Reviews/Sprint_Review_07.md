# Sprint Review 07
---
### Gabe
- What went well?
> I was able to improve the app's client-side performance and overall security by creating more optimized server functions and only returning necessary info to the client. I was also able to balance the workload between the team members more effectively compared to the past few sprints.
- What didn’t go so well?
> This sprint went especially smoothly, so no comment here. Per-component CSS wasn't working for us at first, but we got that resolved fairly quickly.
- What have I learned?
> I learned more details about API controllers and routing HTTP requests and used that knowledge to improve the app's back-end structure.
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing at the moment.
- What will we change to improve?
> I will try to split large issues into multiple, smaller issues if their tasks can be effectively divided.
