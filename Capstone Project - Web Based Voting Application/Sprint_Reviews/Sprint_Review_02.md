# Sprint Review 01
---
### Gabe
- What went well?
> Once we had a clearer understanding of how to proceed with our overall system design, we were able to finalize our front end design.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Before we ironed out the details of our system's design, we were confused and couldn't make progress as quickly as we wanted to due to the uncertainty.
- What have I learned?
> Gaining a clear vision of the system's high-level design early saves time and prevents a lot of future confusion. I also continued to improve my Blazor skills by learning about user authentication, the InputFile component, and how to create custom validation attributes.
- What still puzzles me?
> Finding relevant documentation and examples for a platform as bleeding edge and ever-changing as Blazor is a challenge. Additionally, the details of browser file stream parsing are still a mystery to me but I intend to figure them out during Sprint 3.
- What will we change to improve?
> When we are stuck or confused, we will reach out to each other and/or the instructor as soon as possible.

### Kody
- What went well?
> The things that went really well this week was the research and communication with the client. We figured out a lot about our project going forward and the project is really taking shape.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Some changes had to be made to so me previously made sections so that we could adapt to the new tools we are using.
- What have I learned?
> Sometimes projects can change on the fly and its always better to ask too many questions rather than too few.
- What still puzzles me?
> I haven't set up a database from scratch before so I am still confused on how integration works but I should have more knowledge following Sprint 3.
- What will we change to improve?
> I need to start looking to the code of some of my colleagues who have more understanding in certain areas so I can be follow their lead to get going quicker.

### Devin
- What went well?
> Everyone gained a clearer outlook as to what functionalities and characteristics our client would like the web app to possess.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Everything went smoothly, however, we had to remove/adjust some features to align with what the client is expecting when the web app is completed.
- What have I learned?
> Always ask the client in-depth questions about what they expect the web app's functionalities and characteristics to be when the web app is completed.
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing, everything currently seems clear!
- What will we change to improve?
> We will make sure that we are thoroughly communicating with the client during meetings to ensure that we are on the same page while developing the web app.

### Jiawei
- What went well?
> I think after the communication with the client, we got a clear idea what UI and functionalities is needed for the web app.
- What didn’t go so well?
> The only thing that did not go so well is that we have to remove some of our work due to insufficient communication
- What have I learned?
> Communication is crucial between the developer and the client to ensure exactly how should the product would be like. 
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing for right now.
- What will we change to improve?
> We still need to improve our communication with our client because during this Sprint 2, we have to remove some of our work due to that.
