# Sprint Review 04
---
### Gabe
- What went well?
> I was able to learn a lot about hosting and deployment.
- What didn’t go so well?
> The project was stymied by hosting issues. After hours of research and testing, I determined that Firebase cannot host our application due to lack of proper support for .NET 5, which we require. This consumed most of my effort this week and prevented other active issues from being worked on.
- What have I learned?
> I've learned about different Blazor hosting models, how those models serve their files to the client browser, and how those models are hosted & deployed. Hosting a modern Blazor app with a database for free is impossible unless you do it all yourself. I was also able to learn about Docker and experiment with containerizing our app.
- What still puzzles me?
> Hosting has been put on the backburner for now so we can continue to progress. I will continue looking into hosting our app on my own computer if I have the time; it would involve a great deal more time and effort than hosting with a self-contained solution such as Firebase.
- What will we change to improve?
> In the future, we will prevent one issue from holding up the entire project's progress.

### Kody
- What went well?
> We were able to solve issues that were presented to us quicker and avoid some possible issues.
- What didn’t go so well?
> I am still learning more about styling and looks for the front end so I struggled learning some of the resources.
- What have I learned?
> I have learned more about NoSQL although I still need a little more work. I learned some basics with CSS as well.
- What still puzzles me?
> NoSQL and CSS still have a lot for me to learn.
- What will we change to improve?
> I will have to do more research in my free time in order to better understand the platforms/resources we are using.

### Devin
- What went well?
> We learned that we'll have to just use Firebase locally for this project instead of paying out-of-pocket for another web hosting service.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Everything went smooth for the most part.
- What have I learned?
> Google's web hosting services aren't set up to host all of Microsoft's products.
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing, everything currently seems clear.
- What will we change to improve?
> Nothing needs change, we just need to keep staying persistent and keep communicating any new ideas and/or inputs we may have for this web app.

### Jiawei
- What went well?
> We can use Firebase locally instead of finding another hosting platform for right now.
- What didn’t go so well?
> I am having a problem with where different elections result appear in the same block.
- What have I learned?
> I have learn more about how Blazor works.
- What still puzzles me?
> The create pie chart function that only takes "chartdiv" as a parameter so I cannot give a unique div id to it.
- What will we change to improve?
> I will have look deeper on the pie chart or change the function on the pie chart creation.
