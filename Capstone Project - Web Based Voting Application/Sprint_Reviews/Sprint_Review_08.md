# Sprint Review 08
---
### Gabe
- What went well?
> I was able to implement many visual improvements to the Election Management page. The user can now close elections early and hide concluded elections to eliminate clutter. I was also able to continue balancing the team's workload more appropriately.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Nothing of note.
- What have I learned?
> I learned more about Bootstrap's CSS classes, particularly those related to forms. I also explored the HTTP PUT and DELETE request methods and how to implement them with the Firestore database.
- What still puzzles me?
> HTTP doesn't seem to like sending raw JSON in some cases. We may have to re-format certain requests in the future.
- What will we change to improve?
> We will work to improve communication when we encounter issues that could overlap. This should prevent some confusion.

### Kody
- What went well?
> The page now has a unique theme rather than the default and this went pretty smoothly.
- What didn’t go so well?
> I struggled to get some of the font changes implemented that I wanted and had to compromise.
- What have I learned?
> How CSS works and more about importing.
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing at this time.
- What will we change to improve?
> We are still on the right track and doing well. No complaints.

### Devin
- What went well?
> Users are now able to close elections. I was able to further implement/edit code for the email-notification. 
- What didn’t go so well?
> The electorate email from the csv file is coming in as null for the email recipient in the email notification code but no actual errors are being thrown before attempting to send the email so it's difficult to see why the email is coming in as null.
- What have I learned?
> The SmtpClient class isn't supported in browser code/client, so it has be placed in the server code.
- What still puzzles me?
> How the email in the csv file is coming back as null some how. 
- What will we change to improve?
> Nothing, everyone just needs to keep giving their best effort each sprint.
