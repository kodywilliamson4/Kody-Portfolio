# Sprint Review 01
---
### Gabe
- What went well?
> The basic skeleton for our project was set up very quickly and everyone was able to start working on it almost immediately.
- What didn’t go so well?
> There was some confusion with Git. The gitignore file ended up being an extremely important step to avoid merge conflicts between Visual Studio's output files. Blazor is a very bleeding edge platform which is always updating, so I had to update the project quickly to make sure it didn't affect the other group members too much.
- What have I learned?
> I learned more details about manual version control and how to use gitignore files. I also learned about the most recent Blazor additions and .NET 5.
- What still puzzles me?
> Now that our version control process is more streamlined and the gitignore file is working, the only thing left that puzzles me is managing a group, which is new to me.
- What will we change to improve?
> Hopefully we can move to standardize our branch names and coding practices.

### Kody
- What went well?
> I feel like we got everything set up in a way where we have a good foundation for going forward and it is nice to have that to work upon.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Working with Git at the start was a bit challenging and I think I need to do a bit more research on my end surrounding what exactly the git commands I use do.
- What have I learned?
> I learned basic html and Blazor as well as a little bit of styling in my first round of research.
- What still puzzles me?
> Blazor's forms still are a little confusing to me but the more I read the more I understand so I just need to spend more time learning about them.
- What will we change to improve?
> This wasn't really an issue yet since it was mainly for the initial conversion we needed to do but making sure that each branch is only touching certain files so merges are able to take place more smoothly.

### Devin
- What went well?
> Everyone completed their issues well and in a timely manner!
- What didn’t go so well?
> We had a few complications with our version control when trying to merge things from other branches to the master branch.
- What have I learned?
> I'm not as experienced with Git as I thought.
- What still puzzles me?
> Git (when merging)
- What will we change to improve?
> How we manage merging from other branches to the master branch in Git.

### Jiawei
- What went well?
> I think that every one of our team member completed their issue on time and communicate when we have any problems.
- What didn’t go so well?
> I think that working with Git did not go so well during Sprint 1, but It will get better as we move on.
- What have I learned?
> I learned how to use Blazor and refreshed my memory of how to use Git
- What still puzzles me?
> Mostly Git commands and what they do, but will be better later 
- What will we change to improve?
> Maybe we can let one person handles the merging or tell every team member you are going to merge.
