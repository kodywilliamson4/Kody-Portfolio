- What have I learned?

### Kody
- What went well?
> Was able to mix between our now two fonts in a way that uses a more distinct font for headers and an easier to read and follow font for body text.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Was getting stuck up on using app.css for changes versus using each pages' individual css files.
- What have I learned?
> More about css and how to implement multiple fonts.
- What still puzzles me?
> How different objects decide what elements override others.
- What will we change to improve?
> Nothing as a group I think we are almost done and are doing great.

> Everything went well this sprint.
- What have I learned?
> I learned more about how the get request method/httpget works in c# asp.net.
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing.
- What will we change to improve?
> Nothing, everyone just needs to keep giving their best effort every sprint.
