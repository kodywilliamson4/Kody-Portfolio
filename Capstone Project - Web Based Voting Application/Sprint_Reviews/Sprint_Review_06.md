# Sprint Review 06
---
### Gabe
- What went well?
> All of my voting and results code works as expected. With this, the app is now fully functional locally.
- What didn’t go so well?
> I ran into numerous issues related to the results chart. Because of this, I had to switch to a more Blazor-appropriate library.
- What have I learned?
> I learned more about HTTP request messages in the process of creating the complex results code. I also refreshed my knowledge on ChartJs.Blazor after incorporating it in this project.
- What still puzzles me?
> I'm not sure which of the security requirements have already been fulfilled by using Blazor/SignalR and Firestore.
- What will we change to improve?
> I will be working towards optimizing data requests from the client so that only the necessary data is returned. Any filtering should be run on the server side first.

### Kody
- What went well?
> We made some big improvements on the database side and passing of information.
- What didn’t go so well?
> I wasn't as familiar with adding code to the pages as I thought
- What have I learned?
> I learned more about how the database is accessed and a little more css
- What still puzzles me?
> When I should edit the objects for blazor within the blazor code/when I should edit them within the css code
- What will we change to improve?
> I think we are on a good track but I could ask more/better questions.

### Devin
- What went well?
> We were able to display current elections that the logged-in user is an electorate for, and display whether or not the user has already voted in an election that they're an electorate for.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Everything went smooth for the most part.
- What have I learned?
> How to use more functionalities in C#/Blazor.
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing, everything currently seems clear.
- What will we change to improve?
> Nothing needs change, we just need to keep staying persistent and keep communicating any new ideas and/or inputs we may have for the web app.
