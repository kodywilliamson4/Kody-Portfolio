# Sprint Review 03
---
### Gabe
- What went well?
> I was able to implement basic Firestore database support quickly.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Due to limitations of Firebase hosting, I had to port the project to Blazor WebAssembly. This took the entire class time on Monday and complicated our process slightly. Authentication also had to be temporarily removed due to the switch.
- What have I learned?
> I learned how to implement Firebase support for a web app, how to communicate with a Firestore database through HTTP calls, and how to properly utilize a client-server model in Blazor WebAssembly.
- What still puzzles me?
> NoSQL is a far bigger change from SQL than I thought. We will have to research NoSQL and design a new schema accordingly. Additionally, there may end up being problems when deploying our app to Firebase after implementing Firestore support since the current build only utilizes the Client project.
- What will we change to improve?
> I will work towards better balancing the project workload across all 4 members.

### Kody
- What went well?
> What went well was we were able to get a good foundation set for future sprints and take care of a lot of the smaller parts and research to build the project in the future. 
- What didn’t go so well?
> A lot of our stuff relied on getting web hosting so we had to push back some issues to the next sprint
- What have I learned?
>  I need to look further ahead for my projects since I decided we would use firebase without checking comparability with Blazor Server
- What still puzzles me?
> NoSQL which will be used to store data. I need to do more research into how it is structured and implemented.
- What will we change to improve?
> I think we are on the right path and now that we have a set groundwork we are good to go. Looking ahead is what I think is most important for me.

### Devin
- What went well?
> We figured how to go about hosting our web app on Firebase.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Everything went smoothly, however, we had to convert our web app from being a Blazor server app to being a Blazor WASM app in order to host our web app on Firebase.
- What have I learned?
> How Firebase hosts web apps.
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing, everything currently seems clear.
- What will we change to improve?
> Nothing needs change, we just need to keep staying persistent and keep communicating any new ideas and/or inputs we may have for the web app.

### Jiawei
- What went well?
> We found a way to host our web app in Firebase 
- What didn’t go so well?
> The only thing that did not go so well is that we have to switch our Blazor to Blazor WASM.
- What have I learned?
> Sometimes git pull will overwrite your code and I have to check more carefully next time.
- What still puzzles me?
> Not for right now.
- What will we change to improve?
> I think we did pretty good so far. We bumped into issues like hosting, but we are glad that we found these issues earlier, so it is much easier to correct our issue.
