### Gabe
- What went well?
> The overall UI design of the app is nearly finalized. Validation was also improved.
- What didn’t go so well?
> Lots of work seems to get done near the very end of the sprint, which can make the mornings of demo days very frantic.
- What have I learned?
> I learned that the data of a browser file cannot be viewed before the form is submitted; only the metadata.
- What still puzzles me?
> Nothing of note.
- What will we change to improve?
> I will try and persuade the team to balance their workload throughout the entire sprint to avoid chaos on Wednesday mornings.
